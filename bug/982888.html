  <div style="width: 400px; height: 300px; overflow:scroll; border: solid 1px black">
   this is the outer div
   <div id="inner" style="overflow:scroll; width: 300px; height: 200px; border: solid 1px red">
r to showing the external images, we have a scrollable
    div containing the email contents. Since it's a subframe,
    it starts of with a scroll info layer, let's call it A.

  - The email contents are in an iframe, but that does not
    get its own layer, probably because the iframe is sized
    to fit the document it contains.

  - When you show the external images, the contents of the
    iframe become slightly larger than its scroll port (*) 
    and it also gets a scroll info layer, let's call it B.

       (*) This may not be intentional. If it's not, it can
           probably be fixed in the app.

  - Since scroll info layers do not have children, B is not
    a descendant of A in the layer tree.

  - However, since the element to which B corresponds is a
    child of the element to which A corresponds in the DOM,
    B is above A in the layer tree.

  - When you pan on the email contents, APZ hit testing
    finds B. You can pan it by the very small amount by
    which the iframe contents are larger than its scroll
    port. After that, overscroll handoff kicks in.

  - However, the overscroll handoff chain only walks 
    child -&gt; parent links. Since A is not an ancestor of B,
    A is not an element of B's handoff chain, so A does
    not get the overscroll. As a result, A never scrolls.

  - If you scroll A prior to showing the external images,
    A gets a scrollable layer and B becomes its child,
    and later when B gets its own layer, overscroll handoff
    now works.
   </div>
   end of inner div<br/>
Amusingly, the reason this appeared to work prior to the
regression range from comment 10 is that due to a race 
condition (bug 944047), the synchronous scrolling code 
from BrowserElementPanning.js was being enabled in spite
of APZ being turned on, and the <div> was being scrolled
synchronously!

It's not clear to me what is the best way to fix this in the
1.3 timeframe. 

 - The proper solution is to get overscroll handoff to 
    consider non-ancestor-descendant relationships in the 
    layer tree where appropriate. I don't think we want
    to do that until bug 918288 is fixed, and we almost 
    certainly don't want to uplift that to 1.3. 

  - Bug 982141 will fix the problem in this case by giving
    A a scrollable layer as soon as the page loads (it won't
    solve the problem in general, though). However, I don't
    imagine we want to uplift bug 982141 to 1.3 either.
