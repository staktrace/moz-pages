        <p>Some of us just have a hard time with the softer aspects of UI design (<em>myself especially</em>).  Are "back-end coders" doomed to only design business logic and data layers?  Is there something we can do to <strong>retrain our brain</strong> to be more effective at designing pleasing and useful presentation layers?</p>

<p>Colleagues have recommended a few books me including <em>The Design of Sites</em>, <em>Don't make me think</em> and <em>Why Software sucks</em> , but I am wondering what others have done to remove their deficiencies in this area?</p>

                <p>Let me say it directly: </p>

<p><strong>Improving on this does not begin with guidelines. It begins with reframing how you think about software.</strong></p>

<p>Most hardcore developers have practically <strong>zero</strong> empathy with users of their software. They have <strong>no clue</strong> how users think, how users build models of software they use and how they use a computer in general.</p>

<p>It is a typical problem when an expert collides with a laymen: How on earth could a normal person be so <strong>dumb</strong> not to understand what the expert understood 10 years ago?</p>

<p>One of the first facts to acknowledge that is unbelievably difficult to grasp for almost all experienced developers is this: </p>

<p><strong>Normal people have a vastly different concept of software 
than you have. They have no clue whatsoever of programming. None. Zero. 
And they don't even care. They don't even think they have to care. If 
you force them to, they will delete your program.</strong> </p>

<p>Now that's unbelievably harsh for a developer. He is proud of the 
software he produces. He loves every single feature. He can tell you 
exactly how the code behind it works. Maybe he even invented an 
unbelievable clever algorithm that made it work 50% faster than before.</p>

<p>And the user doesn't care.</p>

<p>What an idiot.</p>

<p>Many developers can't stand working with normal users. They get 
depressed by their non-existing knowledge of technology. And that's why 
most developers shy away and think users must be idiots.</p>

<p>They are not.</p>

<p>If a software developer buys a car, he expects it to run smoothly. He
 usually does not care about tire pressures, the mechanical fine-tuning 
that was important to make it run that way. Here he is <strong>not</strong> the expert. And if he buys a car that does not have the fine-tuning, he gives it back and buys one that does what he wants.</p>

<p>Many software developers like movies. Well-done movies that spark 
their imagination. But they are not experts in producing movies, in 
producing visual effects or in writing good movie scripts. Most nerds 
are very, very, very bad at acting because it is all about displaying 
complex emotions and little about analytics. If a developer watches a 
bad film, he just notices that it is bad as a whole. Nerds have even 
built up IMDB to collect information about good and bad movies so they 
know which ones to watch and which to avoid. But they are not experts in
 creating movies. If a movie is bad, they'll not go to the movies (or 
not download it from BitTorrent ;)</p>

<p>So it boils down to: Shunning normal users as an expert is <strong>ignorance.</strong>
 Because in those areas (and there are so many) where they are not 
experts, they expect the experts of other areas to have already thought 
about normal people who use their products or services. </p>

<p>What can you do to remedy it? The more hardcore you are as a 
programmer, the less open you will be to normal user thinking. It will 
be alien and clueless to you. You will think: I can't imagine how people
 could <strong>ever</strong> use a computer with this lack of knowledge.
 But they can. For every UI element, think about: Is it necessary? Does 
it fit to the concept a user has of my tool? How can I make him 
understand? Please read up on usability for this, there are many good 
books. It's a whole area of science, too.</p>

<p>Ah and before you say it, yes, I'm an Apple fan ;)</p>

                <h1>UI design <em>is</em> hard</h1>

<p>To the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>why is UI design so hard for most developers?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try asking the inverse question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>why is <em>programming</em> so hard for most <em>UI designers</em>?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coding a UI and designing a UI require different skills and a different mindset. UI design is hard for <em>most</em> developers, not <em>some</em> developers, just as writing code is hard for <em>most</em> designers, not <em>some</em> designers. </p>

<p>Coding is hard. Design is hard too. Few people do both well. Good UI 
designers rarely write code. They may not even know how, yet they are 
still good designers. So why do good developers feel responsible for UI 
design? </p>

<p>Knowing more about UI design will make you a better developer, but 
that doesn't mean you should be responsible for UI design. The reverse 
is true for designers: knowing how to write code will make them better 
designers, but that doesn't mean they should be responsible for coding 
the UI.</p>

<h1>How to get better at UI design</h1>

<p>For developers wanting to get better at UI design I have 3 basic pieces of advice:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Recognize design as a separate skill</strong>. Coding and 
design are separate but related. UI design is not a subset of coding. It
 requires a different mindset, knowledge base, and skill group. There 
are people out there who focus on UI design.</li>
<li><strong>Learn about design</strong>. At least a little bit. Try to 
learn a few of the design concepts and techniques from the long list 
below. If you are more ambitious, read some books, attend a conference, 
take a class, get a degree. There are lot of ways to learn about design.
 <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/8032" rel="nofollow">Joel Spolky's book on UI design</a> is a good primer for developers, but there's a lot more to it and that's where designers come into the picture.</li>
<li><strong>Work with designers</strong>. Good designers, if you can. 
People who do this work go by various titles. Today, the most common 
titles are User Experience Designer (UXD), Information Architect (IA), 
Interaction Designer(ID), and Usability Engineer. They think about 
design as much as you think about code. You can learn a lot from them, 
and they from you. Work with them however you can. Find people with 
these skills in your company. Maybe you need to hire someone. Or go to 
some conferences, attend webinars, and spend time in the UXD/IA/ID 
world.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some specific things you can learn. <strong>Don't try to learn everything</strong>. If you knew everything below you could call yourself an interaction designer or an information architect. <strong>Start with things near the top of the list</strong>.
 Focus on specific concepts and skills. Then move down and branch out. 
If you really like this stuff, consider it as a career path. Many 
developers move into managements, but UX design is another option.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn fundamental design concepts</strong>. You should know about affordances, visibility, feedback, mappings, Fitt's law, poka-yokes, and more. I recommend reading <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/768" rel="nofollow">The Design of Everyday Things</a></em> (Don Norman) and <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/62763" rel="nofollow">Universal Principles of Design</a></em> (Lidwell, Holden, &amp; Butler)</li>
<li><strong>Learn about user experience</strong>. This is becoming the 
umbrella term for the human-centered design of web sites, applications, 
and any other digital artifact. The classic primer here is <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/62762" rel="nofollow">The elements of User Experience</a></em> (Jesse James Garrett). You can get an <a href="http://www.jjg.net/elements/" rel="nofollow">overview and the first few chapters from the author's site</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to sketch designs</strong>. Sketching is fast way to <em>explore</em>
 design options and find the right design, whereas usability testing is 
about getting the design right. Paper prototyping is fast, cheap, and 
effective during the early design stages. Much faster than coding a 
digital prototype. The key text here is <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/4701386" rel="nofollow">Sketching User Experience: Getting the design right and the right design</a></em> (<a href="http://billbuxton.com/" rel="nofollow">Bill Buxton</a>).
 Sketching is a particularly useful skill when working with IA/ID/UX 
designers. Your collaboration will be more effective. For a good primer 
on how and why designers sketch, watch the presentation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ugleah/how-to-be-a-ux-team-of-one" rel="nofollow">How to be a UX team of one</a> by Leah Buley from the <a href="http://iasummit.org/" rel="nofollow">2008 IA Summit</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Learn paper prototyping</strong>. The fastest way to iteratively <em>test</em> an interface before you write code. Different from sketching and usability testing. The definitive book here is <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/319043" rel="nofollow">Paper Prototyping</a></em> (Carolyn Snyder). You can get a good DVD on this from the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/prototyping/" rel="nofollow">Nielsen Norman Group</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Learn usability testing</strong>. Discount testing is easy 
and effective. But for many UIs, usability is hard to do well. You can 
learn the basics quickly, but good usability people are invaluable. If 
you want a book, the classic is <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/2292796" rel="nofollow">The Handbook of Usability Testing</a></em> (Jeffrey Rubin). It's older but offers thorough coverage of lab-based testing. The famous starter book is <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/12322" rel="nofollow">Don't Make Me Think (2nd Ed)</a></em>
 (Steve Krug). I caution people about this one: Krug makes it sound 
easier than it is. But it is a good starting point. The user research 
books listed in the next point also cover this topic. And you can find 
piles about it online. </li>
<li><strong>Learn about information architecture</strong>. The main book here is <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/2608" rel="nofollow">Information Architecture for the World Wide Web (3rd)</a></em> (Louis Rosenfeld &amp; Peter Morville). A good starter book is <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/62754" rel="nofollow">Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web</a></em> (Christina Wodtke). For more, visit the <a href="http://iainstitute.org/" rel="nofollow">Information Architecture Institute</a> or attend the annual <a href="http://iasummit.org/" rel="nofollow">Information Architecture Summit</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Learn about interaction design</strong>. The main book here is <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/3037776" rel="nofollow">The Essentials of Interaction Design (3rd)</a></em> (Alan Cooper, <em>et al</em>). A good starter book is <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/1202204" rel="nofollow">Designing for interaction</a></em> (Dan Saffer). For more, visit the <a href="http://ixda.org/" rel="nofollow">Interaction Design Association (IxDA)</a> or attend the annual <a href="http://interaction09.ixda.org/" rel="nofollow">Interaction Design conference</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Learn fundamentals of graphic design</strong>. Graphic 
design is not UI design, but concepts from graphic design can improve an
 interface. Graphic design introduces design principles for the visual 
presentation of information, such as proximity, alignment, and small 
multiples. I recommend reading <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/10038" rel="nofollow">The non-designer's design book</a></em> (Robin Williams) and <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/2815655" rel="nofollow">Envisioning Information</a></em> (Edward Tufte)</li>
<li><strong>Learn to do user research</strong>. Where usability tests an
 interface, user research tries to model users and their tasks through 
personas, scenarios, user journeys, and other documents. It's about 
understanding users and what they do, then using that to inform the 
design instead of guessing. Some techniques are interviews, surveys, 
diary studies, and cart sorting. Good books on this are <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/62757" rel="nofollow">Observing the User Experience</a></em> (Mike Kuniavsky) and <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/457101" rel="nofollow">Understanding Your Users</a></em> (Courage &amp; Baxter)</li>
<li><strong>Learn to do field research</strong>. Watching people in the 
lab under artificial conditions helps (ie: usability), but there is 
nothing like watching people use your code in context: their home, their
 office, or wherever they use it. Goes by various names, including 
ethnography, field studies, and contextual inquiry. Here is <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/essays/archives/000569.php" rel="nofollow">a good primer on field research</a>. Two of the better known books here are <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/1330347" rel="nofollow">Rapid Contextual Design</a></em> (Karen Holtzblatt <em>et al</em>) and <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/311880" rel="nofollow">User and task analysis for interface design</a></em> (Hackos &amp; Redish).</li>
<li><strong>Read UX design web sites</strong>. Some of the big ones are <a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/" rel="nofollow">Boxes &amp; Arrows</a>, <a href="http://www.uxmag.com/" rel="nofollow">UX Mag</a>, <a href="http://uxmatters.com/" rel="nofollow">UX Matters</a>, and <a href="http://digital-web.com/" rel="nofollow">Digital Web magazine</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use UI pattern libraries</strong>. There are patterns for interfaces. For web sites, I recommend <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/5520877" rel="nofollow">The Design of Sites, 2nd ed</a></em> (Van Duyne, <em>et al</em>) and <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/5804" rel="nofollow">Homepage usability: 50 websites deconstructed</a></em> (Jakob Nielsen &amp; Marie Tahir). For desktop applications I recommend <em><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/630562" rel="nofollow">Designing interfaces</a></em> (Jennifer Tidwell), and for web applications I recommend <em><a href="http://designingwebinterfaces.com/" rel="nofollow">Designing Web Interfaces: Principles and Patterns for Rich Interactions</a></em> (Bill Scott &amp; Theresa Neil). Online you should check <a href="http://www.welie.com/patterns/" rel="nofollow">Welie pattern library</a>, <a href="http://ui-patterns.com/" rel="nofollow">UI patterns</a>, and <a href="http://designingwebinterfaces.com/explore" rel="nofollow">Web UI patterns</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Attend UX design conferences</strong>. Some good annual conferences are: <a href="http://iasummit.org/" rel="nofollow">Information Architecture Summit</a>, <a href="http://interaction09.ixda.org/" rel="nofollow">Interaction '09 (IxDA)</a>, <a href="http://www.uie.com/events/uiconf/" rel="nofollow">User Interface</a>, and <a href="http://uxweek.com/" rel="nofollow">UX week</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Attend a workshop or webinar</strong>. You can take workshops, webinars, and online courses. This is far from a comprehensive list, but you might try the <a href="http://www.uie.com/events/virtual%5Fseminars/" rel="nofollow">UIE virtual seminars</a>, <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/events/" rel="nofollow">Adaptive Path virtual seminars</a>, and <a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/webinars/" rel="nofollow">UX webinars from Rosenfeld Media</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get a degree</strong>. A graduate degree in HCI is one 
approach, but these programs are mostly about writing coding. If you 
want to learn about the design of digital artifacts and devices, then 
you want a graduate program that's not in CS. Some options include <a href="http://www.design.cmu.edu/show%5Fprogram.php?s=2&amp;t=3" rel="nofollow">Interaction Design at Carnegie Mellon</a>, the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/dschool/" rel="nofollow">d-School at Stanford</a>, the <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/" rel="nofollow">ITP program at NYU</a>, and <a href="http://www.iakm.kent.edu/" rel="nofollow">Information Architecture &amp; Knowledge Management</a>
 at Kent State (disclosure: I'm on faculty at Kent; we are seeing more 
and more people with CS degrees moving into UX design instead of 
management, which is interesting, because management is the traditional 
path for developers who want to move away from writing code while 
staying in their field). There are many more programs. Each has their 
own perspective, areas of emphasis, and technical expectations. Some 
come out of the arts and visual design, others out of library and 
information science, and some from CS. Most are hybrids, but every 
hybrid has deeper roots in one or more fields. If this interests you, 
look around and try to understand the differences between these 
programs. Some offer online courses and certificate programs in addition
 to full-fledged degrees.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why UI design is hard</h1>

<p>Good UI design is hard because it involves 2 vastly different skills:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A deep understanding of the machine</strong>. People in this
 group worry about code first, people second. They have deep 
technological knowledge and skill. We call them developers, programmers,
 engineers, and so forth.</li>
<li><strong>A deep understanding of people and design</strong>: People 
in this group worry about people first, code second. They have deep 
knowledge of how people interact with information, computers, and the 
world around them. We call them user experience designers, information 
architects, interaction designers, usability engineers, and so forth.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the essential difference between these 2 groups—between developers and designers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Developers make it work</strong>. They implement the 
functionality on your TiVo, your iPhone, your favorite website, etc. 
They make sure it actually does what it is supposed to do. Their highest
 priority is making it work.</li>
<li><strong>Designers make people <em>love</em> it</strong>. They figure
 out how to interact with it, how it should look, and how it should 
feel. They design the experience of using the application, the web site,
 the device. Their highest priority is making you fall in love with what
 developers make. This is what is meant by user experience, and it's not
 the same as brand experience. </li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, programming and design require <em>different mindsets</em>,
 not just different knowledge and different skills. Good UI design 
requires both mindsets, both knowledge bases, both skill groups. And it 
takes years to master either one.</p>

<p>Developers should expect to find UI design hard, just as UI designers should expect to find writing code hard. </p>

<p>Its amazing what you will realize when you watch someone else use your software for the first time</p>

                <p>Ultimately, it's really about empathy -- can you put yourself in the shoes of your user?</p>

<p>One thing that helps, of course, is "eating your own dogfood" -- 
using your applications as a real user yourself, and seeing what's 
annoying.</p>

<p>Another good idea is to find a way to watch a real user using your 
application, which may be as complicated as a usability lab with one-way
 mirrors, screen video capture, video cameras on the users, etc., or can
 be as simple as paper prototyping using the next person who happens to 
walk down the hall.</p>

<p>If all else fails, remember that it's almost always better for the UI
 to be too simple than too complicated.  It's very very easy to say "oh,
 I know how to solve that, I'll just add a checkbox so the user can 
decide which mode they prefer".  Soon your UI is too complicated.  Pick a
 default mode and make the preference setting an advanced configuration 
option.  Or just leave it out.</p>

<p>If you read a lot about design you can easily get hung up on dropped 
shadows and rounded corners and so forth.  That's not the important 
stuff.  Simplicity and discoverability are the important stuff.</p>

                <p>Contrary to popular myth there are literally no soft 
aspects in UI design, at least no more than needed to design a good back
 end.</p>

<p>Consider the following; good back end design is based upon fairly 
solid principles and elements any good developer is familiar with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>low coupling</p></li>
<li><p>high cohesion</p></li>
<li><p>architectural patterns</p></li>
<li><p>industry best practices</p></li>
<li><p>etc</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Good back end design is usually born through a number of 
interactions, where based on the measurable feedback obtained during 
tests or actual use the initial blueprint is gradually improved. 
Sometimes you need to prototype smaller aspects of back end and trial 
them in isolation etc.</p>

<p>Good UI design is based on the sound principles of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>visibility</p></li>
<li><p>affordance</p></li>
<li><p>feedback</p></li>
<li><p>tolerance</p></li>
<li><p>simplicity</p></li>
<li><p>consistency</p></li>
<li><p>structure</p></li>
</ul>

<p>UI is also born through test and trial, through iterations but not 
with compiler + automated test suit, but people. Similarly to back end 
there are industry best practises, measurement and evaluation 
techniques, ways to think of UI and set goals in terms of user model, 
system image, designer model, structural model, functional model etc. </p>

<p>The skill set needed for designing UI is quite different from 
designing back-end and hence don’t expect to be able to do good UI 
without doing some learning first. However that both these activities 
have in common is the process of design. I believe that anyone who can 
design good software is capable of designing good UI as long as they 
spend some time learning how.</p>

<p>I recommend taking a course in Human Computer Interaction, check MIT and Yale site for example for online materials:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-831Fall-2004/LectureNotes/index.htm" rel="nofollow" title="MIT Human Computer Iteraction Course">MIT User Interface Design and Implementation Course</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Structural vs Functional Model in Understanding and Usage</strong></p>

<p>The excellent earlier <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/514083/why-is-ui-design-so-hard-for-some-developers/516180#516180">post by Thorsten79</a>
 brings up the topic of software development experts vs users and how 
their understanding of software differ. Human learning experts 
distinguish between functional and structural mental models. Finding  
way to your friend's house can be an excellent example of the difference
 between the two:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First approach includes a set of detailed instructions: take the 
first exit of the motorway, then after 100 yards turn left etc. This is 
an example of functional model: list of concrete steps necessary to 
achieve a certain goal. Functional models are easy to use, they do not 
require much thinking just a straight forward execution. Obviously there
 is a penalty for the simplicity: it might not be the most efficient 
route and any any exceptional situation (i.e. a traffic diversion) can 
easilly lead to a complete failure.</p></li>
<li><p>A different way to cope with the task is to build a structural 
mental model. In our example that would be a map that conveyes a lot of 
information about the internal structure of the "task object". From 
understanding the map and relative locations of our and friend's house 
we can deduct the functional model (the route). Obviously it's requires 
more effort, but much more reliable way of completing the task in spite 
of the possible deviations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The choice between conveying functional or structural model through 
UI (for example, wizard vs advanced mode) is not that straight forward 
as it might seem from Thorsten79's post. Advanced and frequent users 
might well prefer the structural model, whereas occassional or less 
expirienced users — functional.</p>

                <p>There's a huge difference between design and aesthetics, and they are often confused. </p>

<p>A beautiful UI requires artistic or at least aesthetic skills that 
many, including myself, are incapable of producing. Unfortunately, it is
 not enough and does not make the UI usable, as we can see in many 
heavyweight flash-based APIs.</p>

<p>Producing usable UIs requires an understanding of how humans interact
 with computers, some issues in psychology (e.g., Fitt's law, Hick's 
law), and other topics. Very few CS programs train for this. Very few 
developers that I know will pick a user-testing book over a JUnit book, 
etc.</p>

<p>Many of us are also "core programmers", tending to think of UIs as 
the facade rather than as a factor that could make or break the success 
of our project.</p>

<p>In addition, most UI development experience is extremely frustrating.
 We can either use toy GUI builders like old VB and have to deal with 
ugly glue code, or we use APIs that frustrate us to no end, like trying 
to sort out layouts in Swing.</p>

                <p>Go over to Slashdot, and read the comments on any 
article dealing with Apple.  You'll find a large number of people 
talking about how Apple products are nothing special, and ascribing the 
success of the iPod and iPhone to people trying to be trendy or hip.  
They will typically go through feature lists, and point out that they do
 nothing earlier MP3 players or smart phones didn't do.</p>

<p>Then there are people who like the iPod and iPhone because they do 
what the users want simply and easily, without reference to manuals.  
The interfaces are about as intuitive as interfaces get, memorable, and 
discoverable.  I'm not as fond of the UI on MacOSX as I was on earlier 
versions, I think they've given up some usefulness in favor of glitz, 
but the iPod and iPhone are examples of superb design.</p>

<p>If you are in the first camp, you don't think the way the average 
person does, and therefore you are likely to make bad user interfaces 
because you can't tell them from good ones.  This doesn't mean you're 
hopeless, but rather that you have to explicitly learn good interface 
design principles, and how to recognize a good UI (much as somebody with
 Asperger's might need to learn social skills explicitly).   Obviously, 
just having a sense of a good UI doesn't mean you can make one; my 
appreciation for literature, for example, doesn't seem to extend to the 
ability (currently) to write publishable stories. </p>

<p>So, try to develop a sense for good UI design.  This extends to more 
than just software.  Don Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things" is a 
classic, and there's other books out there.  Get examples of successful 
UI designs, and play with them enough to get a feel for the difference. 
 Recognize that you may be having to learn a new way of thinking abou 
things, and enjoy it.</p>

                <p>The main rule of thumb I hold to, is never try to do 
both at once.  If I'm working on back-end code, I'll finish up doing 
that, take a break, and return with my UI hat on.  If you try to work it
 in whilst you're doing code, you'll approach it with the wrong mindset,
 and end up with some horrible interfaces as a result.</p>

<p>I think it's definitely possible to be both a good back-end developer
 and a good UI designer, you just have to work at it, do some reading 
and research on the topic (everything from Miller's #7, to Nielsen's 
archives), and make sure you understand <em>why</em> UI design is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>I don't think it's a case of needing to be creative but rather, like 
back-end development, it is a very methodical, very structured thing 
that needs to be learned.  It's people getting 'creative' with UIs that 
creates some of the biggest usability monstrosities... I mean, take a 
look at 100% Flash websites, for a start...</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Krug's book is really good... do take a read of it, especially if you're going to be designing for the Web.</p>

                <p>There are many reasons for this.</p>

<p>(1) Developer fails to see things from the point of view of the user.
 This is the usual suspect: lack of empathy. But it is not usually true 
since developers are not as alien as people make them out to be.</p>

<p>(2) Another, more common reason is that the developer being so close 
to his own stuff, having stayed with his stuff for so long, fails to 
realize that his stuff may not be so familiar(a term better than 
intuitive) to other people.</p>

<p>(3) Still another reason is the developer lacks techniques. </p>

<p>MY BIG CLAIM: read any UI, human interection design, prototyping 
book. e.g. Designing the Obvious: A Common Sense Approach to Web 
Application Design, Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web 
Usability, Designing the moment, whatever.</p>

<p>How do they discuss task flows? How do they describe decision points?
 That is, in any use case, there are at least 3 paths: success, 
failure/exception, alternative.</p>

<p>Thus, from point A, you can go to A.1, A.2, A.3.
From point A.1, you can get to A.1.1, A.1.2,  A.1.3, and so on.</p>

<p>How do they show such drill-down task flow?
They don't. They just gloss over it.</p>

<p>Since even UI experst don't have a technique, developers have no chance.
He thinks it is clear in his head. But it is not even clear on paper, let alone clear in software implementation.</p>

<p>I have to use my own hand-made techniques for this.</p>

                <p>I try to keep in touch with design-specific websites and texts. I found also the excellent Robin Williams book <b><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321534042" rel="nofollow">The Non-Designer's Design Book</a></b> to be very interesting in these studies.</p>

<p>I believe that design and usability is a very important part of 
software engineering and we should learn it more and stop giving excuses
 that we are not supposed to do design.</p>

<p>Everyone can be a designer once in a while, as also everyone can be a programmer.</p>

                <p>When approaching UI design, here are a few of the things I keep in mind throughout (by far not a complete list):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Communicating a model</strong>. The UI is a narrative 
that explains a mental model to the user. This model may be a business 
object, a set of relationships, what have you. The visual prominence, 
spatial placement, and workflow ordering all play a part in 
communicating this model to the user. For example, a certain kind of 
list vs another implies different things, as well as the relationship of
 what's in the list to the rest of the model. In general I find it best 
to make sure only one model is communicated at a time. Programmers 
frequently try to communicate more than one model, or parts of several, 
in the same UI space.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency</strong>. Re-using popular UI metaphors helps a lot. Internal consistency is also very important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grouping of tasks</strong>. Users should not have to move
 the mouse all the way across the screen to verify or complete a related
 sequence of commands. Modal dialogs and flyout-menus can be especially 
bad in this area.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowing your audience</strong>. If your users will be 
doing the same activities over and over, they will quickly become power 
users at those tasks and be frustrated by attempts to lower the initial 
entry barrier. If your users do many different kinds of activities 
infrequently, it's best to ensure the UI holds their hand the whole 
time.</p></li>
</ul>

                <p>I find the best tool in UI design is to watch a 
first-time User attempt to use the software. Take loads of notes and ask
 them some questions. Never direct them or attempt to explain how the 
software works. This is the job of the UI (and well written 
documentation).</p>

<p>We consistently adopt this approach in all projects. It is always 
fascinating to watch a User deal with software in a manner that you 
never considered before.</p>

<p>Why is UI design so hard? Well generally because the Developer and User never meet.</p>

                <p>duffymo just reminded me why: Many Programmers think "*Design" == "Art".</p>

<p>Good UI design is absolutely not artistic. It follows solid 
principles, that can be backed up with data if you've got the time to do
 the research.</p>

<p>I think all programmers need to do is take the time to learn the 
principles. I think it's in our nature to apply best practice whenever 
we can, be it in code or in layout. All we need to do is make ourselves 
aware of what the best practices are for this aspect of our job.</p>

                <p>What have I done to become better at UI design?<br>
  <strong>Pay attention to it!</strong>    </p>

<p>It's like how ever time you see a chart on the news or an electronic 
bus sign and you wonder 'How did they get that data? Did they do that 
with raw sql or are they using LINQ?' (or insert your own common geek 
curiosity here).  </p>

<p>You need to start doing that but with visual elements of all kinds.</p>

<p>But just like learning a new language, if you don't <em>really</em> throw yourself into it, you won't ever learn it.  </p>

<p>Taken from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15373/non-tech-skills-that-complement-programming">another answer</a> I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learn to look, really look, at the world around you. Why do I like 
that UI but hate this one? Why is it so hard to find the noodle dishes 
in this restaurant menu? Wow, I knew what that sign meant before I even 
read the words. Why was that? How come that book cover looks so wrong? 
Learn to take the time to think about why you react the way you do to 
visual elements of all kinds, and then apply this to your work.</p>

                <p>However you do it (and there are some great points 
above), it really helped me once I accepted that there is NO SUCH THING 
AS INTUITIVE....</p>

<p>I can hear the arguments rumbling on the horizon... so let me explain a little.</p>

<p>Intuitive: using what one feels to be right or true based on an unconscious method or feeling.</p>

<p>If (as Carl Sagan postulated) you accept that you cannot comprehend 
things that are absolutely unlike anything you have ever encountered 
then how could you possibly "know" how to use something if you have 
never used anything remotely like it?</p>

<p>Think about it: kids try to open doors not because they "know" how a 
doorknob works, but because they have seen someone else do it... often 
they turn the knob in the wrong direction, or pull too soon. They have 
to LEARN how a doorknob works. This knowledge then gets applied in 
different but similar instances: opening a window, opening a drawer, 
opening almost anything big with a big, knob-looking handle.</p>

<p>Even simple things that seem intuitive to us will not be intuitive at
 all to people from other cultures. If someone held their arm out in 
front of them and waived their hand up-and-down at the wrist while 
keeping the arm still.... are they waiving you away? Probably, unless 
you are in Japan. There, this hand signal can mean "come here". So who 
is right? Both, of course, in their own context. But if you travel to 
both, you need to know both... UI design.</p>

<p>I try to find the things that are already "familiar" to the potential
 users of my project and then build the UI around them: user-centric 
design.</p>

<p>Take a look at Apple's iPhone. Even if you hate it, you have to 
respect the amount of thought that went into it. Is it perfect? Of 
course not. Over time an object's perceived "intuitiveness" can grow or 
even fade away completely.</p>

<p>For example. Most everyone knows that a strip of black with two rows 
of holes along the top and bottom looks like a film strip... or do they?</p>

<p>Ask your average 9 or 10 year old what they think it is. You may be 
surprised how many kids right now will have a hard time identifying it 
as a film strip, even though it is something that is still used to 
represent Hollywood, or anything film (movie) related. Most movies for 
the past 20 years have been digitally shot. And when was the last time 
any of us held a piece of film of ANY kind, photos or film?</p>

<p>So, what it all boils down to for me is: Know your audience and 
constantly research to keep up with trends and changes in things that 
are "intuitive", target your main users and try not to do things that 
punish the inexperienced in favor of the advanced users or slow down the
 advanced users in order to hand-hold the novices.</p>

<p>Ultimately, every program will require a certain amount of training 
on the user's part to use it. How much training and for which level of 
user is part of the decisions that need to be made.</p>

<p>Some things are more or less familiar based on your target user's 
past experience level as a human being, or computer user, or student, or
 whatever.</p>

<p>I just shoot for the fattest part of the bell curve and try to get as
 many people as I can but realizing that I will never please 
everyone....</p>

                <p>I know that Microsoft is rather inconsistent with 
their own guidelines, but I have found that reading their Windows design
 guidelines have really helped me. I have a copy on my website <a href="http://www.dcomproductions.com/downloads/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, just scroll down a little the the Vista UX Guide. It has helped me with things such as colors, spacing, layouts, and more.</p>

                <p>I believe the main problem has nothing to do with 
different talents or skillsets. The main problem is that as a developer,
 you know too much about what the application does and how it does it, 
and you automatically design your UI from the point of view of someone 
who has that knowledge.</p>

<p>Whereas a user typically starts out knowing absolutely nothing about 
the application and should never need to learn anything about its inner 
workings.</p>

<p>It is very hard, almost impossible, to not use knowledge that you 
have - and that's why an UI should not be designed by someone who's 
developing the app behind it.</p>

                <p>"Designing from both sides of the screen" presents a 
very simple but profound reason as to why programmers find UI design 
hard: programmers are trained to think in terms of edge cases while UI 
designers are trained to think in terms of common cases or usage.</p>

<p>So going from one world to the other is certainly difficult if the default traning in either is the exact opposite of the other.</p>

                <p>To say that programms suck at UI design is to miss 
the point. The point of the problem is that the formal training that 
most developers get go indepth with the technology. Human - Computer 
Interaction is not a simple topic. It is not something that I can 
"mind-meld" to you by providing a simple one line statement that makes 
you realize "oh the users will use this application more effectively if I
 do x instead of y."</p>

<p>This is because there is one part of UI design that you are missing. 
The human brain. In order to understand how to design a UI, you have to 
understand how the human mind interacts with machinery. There is an 
excellent course I took at the University of Minnesota on this topic 
taught by a professor of Psychology. It is named "Human - Machine 
Interaction". This describes many of the reasons of why UI design is so 
complicated.</p>

<p>Since Psychology is based on Correlations and not Causality you can 
never prove that a method of UI design will always work in any given 
situation. You can correlate that many users will find a particular UI 
design appealing or efficient, but you cannot prove that it will always 
generalize.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are two parts to UI design that many people seem 
to miss. There is the aesthetical appeal, and the functional workflow. 
If you go for a 100% aesthetical appeal, sure people will but your 
product. I highly doubt that aesthetics will ever reduce user 
frustration though. </p>

<p>There are several good books on this topic and course to take (like Bill Buxton's <a href="http://www.billbuxton.com/bookFlyer.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>Sketching User Experiences</em></a>, and <a href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/hutchins/citw.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Cognition in the Wild</em></a> by Edwin Hutchins). There are graduate programs on Human - Computer Interaction at many universities.</p>

<p>The overall answer to this question though lies in how individuals 
are taught computer science. It is all math based, logic based and not 
based on the user experience. To get that, you need more than a generic 4
 year computer science degree (unless your 4 year computer science 
degree had a minor in psychology and was emphasized in Human - Computer 
Interaction). </p>

                <p>Let's turn your question around - </p>

<p><em>Are "ui designers" doomed to only design information architecture
 and presentation layers? Is there something they can do to retrain 
their brains to be more effective at designing pleasing and efficient 
system layers?</em></p>

<p>Seems like them "ui designers" would have to take a completely 
different perspective - they'd have to look from the inside of the box 
outwards; instead of looking in from outside the box.</p>

<p>Alan Cooper's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=04cFCVXC_AUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=alan+cooper+the+inmates#PPP1,M1" rel="nofollow">"The Inmates are Running the Asylum"</a> opinion is that we can't successfully take both perspectives - we can learn to wear one hat well but we can't just switch hats.</p>

                <p>A useful framing is to actively consider what you're 
doing as designing a process of communication.  In a very real sense, 
your interface is a language that the user must use to tell the computer
 what to do.  This leads to considering a number of points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the user already speak this language?  Using a highly 
idiosyncratic interface is like communicating in a language you've never
 spoken before.  So if your interface must be idiosyncratic at all, it 
had best introduce itself with the simplest of terms and few 
distractions.  On the other hand, if your interface uses idioms that the
 user is accustomed to, they'll gain confidence from the start.</li>
<li>The enemy of communication is noise.  Auditory noise interferes with
 spoken communication; visual noise interferes with visual 
communication.  The more noise you can cut out of your interface, the 
easier communicating with it will be.</li>
<li>As in human conversation, it's often not what you say, it's how you 
say it.  The way most software communicates is rude to a degree that 
would get it punched in the face if it were a person.  How would you 
feel if you asked someone a question and they sat there and stared at 
you for several minutes, refusing to respond in any other way, before 
answering?  Many interface elements, like progress bars and automatic 
focus selection, have the fundamental function of politeness.  Ask 
yourself how you can make the user's day a little more pleasant.</li>
</ol>

<p>Really, it's somewhat hard to determine what programmers think of interface interaction as being, <i>other</i> than a process of communication, but maybe the problem is that it doesn't get thought of as being anything at all.</p>

                <p>There are a lot o good comments already, so I am not sure there is much I can add.
But still...</p>

<ul>
<li>Why would a developer expect to be able to design good UI?</li>
<li>How much training did he had in that field?</li>
<li>How many books did he read?</li>
<li>How many things did he designed over how many years?</li>
<li>Did he had the opportunity to see the reaction of it's users?</li>
</ul>

<p>We don't expect that a random "Joe the plumber" to be able to write good code.
So why would we expect the random "Joe the programmer" to design good UI?</p>

<p>Empathy helps. Separating the UI design and the programming helps. Usability testing helps.</p>

<p>But UI design is a craft that has to be learned, and practiced, like any other.</p>

                <p>To improve just look around at existing sites. In 
addition to the books already suggested, you might like to have a look 
at Robin Williams's excellent book "The Non-designers Design Book" (<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321534042" rel="nofollow">sanitised Amazon link</a>)</p>

<p>Have a look at what's possible in visual design by taking a look at the various submissions over at <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" rel="nofollow">The Zen Garden</a> as well.</p>

<p>UI design is definitely an art though, like pointers in C, some people get it and some people don't.</p>

<p>But at least <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/comic/4.html" rel="nofollow">we can have a chuckle at their attempts</a>. BTW Thanks OK/Cancel for a funny comic and thanks Joel for putting it in your book "The Best Software Writing I" (<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590595009" rel="nofollow">sanitised Amazon link</a>).</p>

                <p>User interface isn't something that can be applied 
after the fact, like a thin coat of paint. It is something that needs to
 be there at the start, and based on real research. There's tons of 
Usability research available of course. It needs to not just be there at
 the start, it needs to form the core of the very reason you're making 
the software in the first place: There's some gap in the world out 
there, some problem, and it needs to be made more usable and more 
efficient. </p>

<p>Software is not there for its own sake. The reason for a peice of 
software to exist is FOR PEOPLE. It's absolutely ludicrous to even try 
to come up with an idea for a new peice of software, without 
understanding why anyone would need it. Yet this happens all the time.</p>

<p>Before a single line of code is written, you should go through paper 
versions of the interface, and test it on real people. This is kind of 
weird and silly, it works best with kids, and someone entertaining 
acting as "the computer".</p>

<p>The interface needs to take advantage of our natural cognitive 
facilities. How would a caveman use your program? For instance, we've 
evolved to be really good at tracking moving objects. That's why 
interfaces that use physics simulations, like the iphone, work better 
than interfaces where changes occur instantaneously.</p>

<p>We are good at certain kinds of abstraction, but not others. As 
programmers, we're trained to do mental gymnastics and backflips to 
understand some of the weirdest abstractions. For instance, we 
understand that a sequence of arcane text can represent and be 
translated into a pattern of electromagnetic state on a metal platter, 
which when encountered by a carefully designed device, leads to a 
sequence of invisible events that occur at lightspeed on an electronic 
circuit, and these events can be directed to produce a useful outcome. 
This is an incredibly unnatural thing to have to understand. Understand 
that while it's got a perfectly rational explanation to us, to the 
outside world, it looks like we're writing incomprehensible incantations
 to summon invisible sentient spirits to do our bidding.</p>

<p>The sorts of abstractions that normal humans understand are things 
like maps, diagrams, and symbols. Beware of symbols, because symbols are
 a very fragile human concept that take conscious mental effort to 
decode, until the symbol is learned.</p>

<p>The trick with symbols is that there has to be a clear relationship 
between the symbol, and the thing it represents. The thing it represents
 either has to be a noun, in which case the symbol should look VERY MUCH
 like the thing it represents. If a symbol is representing a more 
abstract concept, that has to be explained IN ADVANCE. See the 
inscrutable unlabled icons in msword's, or photoshop's toolbar, and the 
abstract concepts they represent. It has to be LEARNED that the crop 
tool icon in photoshop means CROP TOOL. it has to be understood what 
CROP even means. These are prerequisites to correctly using that 
software. Which brings up an important point, beware of ASSUMED 
knowledge.</p>

<p>We only gain the ability to understand maps around the age of 4. I 
think I read somewhere once that chimpanzees gain the ability to 
understand maps around the age of 6 or 7. </p>

<p>The reason that guis have been so successful to begin with, is that 
they changed a landscape of mostly textual interfaces to computers, to 
something that mapped the computer concepts to something that resembled a
 physical place. Where guis fail in terms of usability, is where they 
stop resembling something you'd see in real life. There are invisible, 
unpredictable, incomprehensible things that happen in a computer that 
bare no resemblance to anything you'd ever see in the physical world. 
Some of this is necessary, since there'd be no point in just making a 
reality simulator- The idea is to save work, so there has to be a bit of
 magic. But that magic has to make sense, and be grounded in an 
abstraction that human beings are well adapted to understanding. It's 
when our abstractions start getting deep, and layered, and mismatched 
with the task at hand that things break down. In other words, the 
interface doesn't function as a good map for the underlying software.</p>

<p>There are lots of books. The two I've read, and can therefore 
reccomend, are "The Design of Everyday Things" by donald norman, and 
"The Human Interface" by Jef Raskin.</p>

<p>I also reccomend a course in psychology. "The Design of Every day 
Things" talks about this a bit. A lot of interfaces break down because 
of a developer's "folk understanding" of psychology. This is similar to 
"folk physics". An object in motion stays in motion doesn't make any 
sense to most people. "You have to keep pushing it to keep it in 
motion!" thinks the physics novice. User testing doesn't make sense to 
most developers. "You can just ask the users what they want, and that 
should be good enough!" thinks the psychology novice.</p>

<p>I reccomend Discovering Psychology, a PBS documentary series, hosted 
by Philip Zimbardo. Failing that, try and find a good physics textbook. 
The expensive kind. Not the pulp fiction self help crap that you find in
 Borders, but the thick hardbound stuff you can only find in a 
university library. This is a necesesary foundation. You can do good 
design without it, but you'll only have an intuitive understanding of 
what's going on. Reading some good books will give you a good 
perspective.</p>

                <p>If you read the book "Why software sucks" you would have seen Platt's answer, which is a simple one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developers prefere control over user-friendliness</li>
<li>Average people prefere user-friendliness over control</li>
</ol>

<p>But another another answer to your question would be "why is 
dentistry so hard for some developers?" - UI design is best done by a UI
 designer.</p>
